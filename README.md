# SCHOOL TRIP DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is done as an internal assessment in high school IB programme.

My client was a teacher who needed a system to manage trips in our school. This product allows fluent interface and communication between teachers and managers/administration and ensures that none of the data would be lost and could be stored permanently in a digital footprint. After an event is created a word document is generated using all the information given to it and stored in a database.

**Bellow is a video of me explaining all the functionality of this project.**
